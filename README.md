### BIO
I am very interested in how ecological communityâ€™s function. I enjoy observing the connectiveness of inter and intraspecies relationships and strive to better understand how these relationships can be preserved in an ever-changing world.
I have an appreciation for what data science can provide ecologists in the way of gathering and analysing data. The utilization of AI and single board computing opens unlimited opportunities to gather robust data in sustainable and adaptable ways.
I have a passion for sound, particularly, its use as a tool for revealing layers of detail amongst complex ecological communities.
